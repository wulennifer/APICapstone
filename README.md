# Fur Finder

This project uses the Petfinder and Google Maps API to create an application that lets users find nearby shelters &amp; their adoptable pets. User begins by entering a zipcode into the search form at the top of the page. Based off of the zipcode entered, a list of nearby shelters gets appended to the bottom of the page with their addresses added as markers onto the map. When a shelter is clicked, a modal appears with a list of all available pets from that shelter along with additional information about each pet.

## Motivation
